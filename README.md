<img src=https://www2.lehigh.edu/sites/www2/files/media/chuah17conference.jpg width="1100" height="300" />

We are developing a disease predicting web application using the concept of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to make predictions about various diseases like ```Breast Cancer Malaria, Pneumonia, Diabetes, Brain tumour, Leaf disease``` etc.





## Tools Required: 
<ul>
<li><p><b>Python ( 3.7+ version)</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Flask</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>OpenCV</b></p></li>
 <li><p><b>Keras</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Pandas</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Numpy</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>HTML5</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>CSS3</b></p></li>
</ul>

## Datasets
 - Pneumonia : [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
 - Brain tumour : [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)
 - Diabetes : diabetes.csv
 - Heart disease : heart.csv
 - Breast Cancer : data.csv


## Impact in the Real World

We are developing this project which involves the prediction of many diseases based on the user input which consists of facts or ```Radiography images```.  And also we will be providing all the required information about the disease ```caused```, ```symptoms``` and its ```prevention``` in our web site.. After developing the model, itâ€™s ```UI``` and every document, the whole project will be deployed on ```Heroku Cloud```  or ```Netlify cloud```. We are expecting to complete the whole project within one month.
