We are developing a disease predicting web application using the concept of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to make predictions about various diseases like ```Breast Cancer Malaria```, ```Pneumonia, Diabetes```, ```Brain tumour```, ```Leaf disease``` etc.

## Impact
<p> Impact in the real world</p>

We are developing this project which involves the prediction of many diseases based on the user input which consists of facts or ```Radiography images```.  And also we will be providing all the required information about the disease ```caused```, ```symptoms``` and its ```prevention``` in our web site.. After developing the model, it’s ```UI``` and every document, the whole project will be deployed on ```Heroku Cloud```  or ```Netlify cloud```. We are expecting to complete the whole project within one month.
