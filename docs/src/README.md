# Onsite Health Diagnostic (OHD)

![Screenshot](disease2page.png)
<p>             Onsite Health Diagnostic (OHD) is the web application that allows users to predict whether the user has been infected with a menacing disease or not.
These diseases can be very dangerous to health if they are not treated properly.
The main objective of OHD is to help people predict the disease in case of absence of medical professionals, strikes or any related uncertainties.</p>
<br>
<p>The Machine learning algorithm deployed along with the website will diagnose the disease as accurately as possible. Nevertheless, the project is based on educational purposes and we will not be responsible in any possible way if the model predicts false results because the ML model can’t be correct 100% all the time either. So, we urge users to try it at your own risk.
